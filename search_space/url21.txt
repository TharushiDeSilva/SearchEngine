These tools assist you in analysing the garbage collection (GC) log files produced by the JVM when using -verbosegc or -Xloggc:.. or equivalent. GC log file analysis is the most useful technique for identifying exactly what your JVM is doing in terms of GC, and also provides the most useful data for tuning the GC.
